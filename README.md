# Design Challenge

Design and create a unity package that enables game developers to prototype and implement a variety of firearms and guns into their games, without having to create their own weapons from scratch.

## Context

As of late, I've gotten into editor scripting. This is due to the fact I've felt the effects of **Developer Experience** not being a secondary, or even tertiary thought when developing a system for a game. This leads to situations where setting up prefabs, systems or gameplay components can be a giant pain.

So with my new skills, I aim to help my fellow developers by creating a framework for guns within videogames.

## Deliverable

A unity package, containing:

- Weapon Framework
  - Supporting Hitcast & Projectile
  - Incredibly Customisable
  - Basic Health System
- A Demo Scene
- Relevant Documentation
